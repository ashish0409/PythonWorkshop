# What more should you read and do?

- First, do the homework and discuss it on our [community forums](https://discourse.univ.ai). Feel free to ask any and all questions there.
- If you have the time, the material from [Software Carpentry's Python workshop](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) is quite good:
- If you would like to learn all aspects of Python (and some math and stats) needed to do AI, our [PyDS](https://welcome.univ.ai/courses/pyds/) course is great!
- [Jake Vanderplas's Book](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is a great resource.
